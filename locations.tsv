The Gibbes houses a premier collection of over 10,000 works of fine art, principally American works, many with a connection to Charleston or the South. The benefactor, James Shoolbred Gibbes, donated $100,000 to the Carolina Arts Association upon his death in 1899 for the "erection of a suitable building for the exhibitions of paintings." Receipt of the money by the city, however, was delayed by a will contest filed by nieces and nephews of Gibbes. Their case was heard in the state court of New York during 1900 and 1901. On December 6, 1901, the New York Supreme Court (the state's trial-level court) issued an opinion declaring that the gift to Charleston was valid.[1][2] Receiving the money in 1903, the Association hired Frank Pierce Milburn to design the gallery. His design included a Tiffany-style dome, Doric columns and pediment capped windows and doors. Milburn completed the drawings of the building in mid-1903, and a drawing of the proposed building appeared in the Charleston Evening Post on June 5, 1903.[3] Notices were published seeking contractors' bids for the work starting in August 1903.[4] In September 1903, H.T. Zacharias was selected as the contractor and received a contract for $73,370 for the building.[5] Zacharias started work on September 28, 1903, removing the remains of the South Carolina Agricultural Hall which had occupied the lot.[6] Although work on the foundations had begun already, a ceremony was held on December 8, 1903, to lay the cornerstone of the building at the northeast corner.[7] The museum formally opened on April 11, 1905. The collection on display on the opening day included more than 300 pictures, many bronzes, and about 200 miniatures in addition to an "instructive collection" of Japanese prints.[8] At present, the museum is completing a year and a half renovation project through the generosity of over 400 individuals and organizations. The renewal was necessary for a building that is 111 years old, but, more importantly, has provided the opportunity for a new vision for the museum -- where art is created, explored, as well as displayed. Public spaces on the first floor include artist studios, lecture rooms, reception rooms, cafe, and gift shop which opens onto a world class garden suitable for weddings or other festive gatherings. The second floor retains its Beaux Arts elegance, but now will have improved LED lighting and an ingenious display for its famous collection of American art miniatures. Office space on the second and third floors has been reconfigured to provide increased area for new exhibits and a dynamic display of "The Charleston Story" . The Gibbes will now enhance lives through art for the entire diverse community that lives in and visits Charleston.[citation needed] The museum's collections include the work of numerous artists with connections to Charleston; among them are Henrietta Johnston, Mary Roberts, Charles Fraser, William Melton Halsey,[9] and Jeremiah Theus.

http://www.charleston-sc.com/img/content/white-point-02.jpg	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Point_Garden	The Battery is a landmark defensive seawall and promenade in Charleston, South Carolina. Named for a civil-war coastal defense artillery battery at the site, it stretches along the lower shores of the Charleston peninsula, bordered by the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, which meet here to form Charleston harbor. Historically, it has been understood to extend from the beginning of the seawall at the site of the former Omar Shrine Temple (40-44 East Bay Street) to the intersection of what is now Murray Boulevard and King Street. The higher part of the promenade, paralleling East Battery, as the street is known south of Water Street, to the intersection of Murray Boulevard, is known as High Battery. Fort Sumter is visible from the Cooper River side (High Battery) and from the point, as are Castle Pinckney, the World War II aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-10), Fort Moultrie, and Sullivan's Island.As a tourist destination, the Battery is famous for its stately, mainly antebellum homes. Included among the grand houses are the Louis DeSaussure House (1 East Battery), the Roper House (9 East Battery), the William Ravenel House (13 East Battery),the Edmondston-Alston House (21 East Battery), the Charles Drayton House (25 East Battery), the Villa Margherita (4 South Battery), the William Washington House (8 South Battery), the Col. John A.S. Ashe House (26 South Battery), the James Spear House (30 South Battery), and the Col. John Ashe House (32 South Battery). Fort Broughton (ca. 1735) and Fort Wilkins (during the American Revolution and War of 1812) occupied White or Oyster Point, so named because of the piles of bleached oyster shells on the point at the tip of the peninsula. In the 18th century, rocks and heavy materials were used to fortify the shore of the Cooper River on the eastern side of the peninsula. In 1838, this area along the seawall became a promenade. First used as a public park in 1837, the area now known as White Point Garden became a place for artillery during the American Civil War. In popular speech and in a number of unofficial guidebooks and Web sites, The Battery and White Point Garden are sometimes referred to as "Battery Park," but the park and seawall promenade are not regarded by the City of Charleston as a single entity, and the term "Battery Park" is not an official designation. In 2004, a structural report by the City of Charleston showed that the Battery was suffering serious problems and could fail to protect the southeastern portion of the city during hurricanes. In 2012, the City announced that a $3.2 million restoration project would soon commence at the juncture of High Battery (along East Battery) and Low Battery (along Murray Blvd.).[1] from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battery_(Charleston) 	The Battery/White Point Gardens	2 Murray Blvd, Charleston, SC 29401	32.769876	-79.930424	parks	32.770509, -79.931948, 32.770004, -79.928675, 32.769354, -79.928997, 32.769584, -79.931846

Finished in 1990, Waterfront Park is a favorite of visitors and locals alike, offering fantastic views of the Charleston harbor. The park covers more than 1,000 feet along the coasts and allows visitors a chance to sit and relax after a long day of shopping and sightseeing. Visitors can watch sailboats cruising the waters and large ships heading in and out of the harbor. Old-fashioned park benches dot the park, and family-sized swings offer a fun way to spend a relaxing afternoon together. A large rectangular lawn provides a great spot for picnics and sunning. Walkways are ideal for strolling, and two large fountains make for fantastic places for children to play, splash and cool off. It is one of the parks that boasts floral displays throughout the year. The fountains light at night, offering a truly spectacular scene along the harbor's waterfront. The park is also centrally located near The Market and other great shopping and sightseeing areas.

http://www.sciway.net/sc-photos/wp-content/uploads/hampton-park.jpg	http://www.charlestonparksconservancy.org/our_parks/view_park/hampton_park/	Hampton Park is one of the City of Charleston's largest parks. It boasts the most extensive floral displays of any park in the city. An old rose collection and seasonal displays are planted by the staff and volunteers caring for the park. This neighborhood park has a rich history recently documented through a project of the Charleston Horticultural Society, an audio walking tour called Layers of the Landscape. This park is home to many activities year round. Weddings, family reunions and many Frisbee games are but a few of the diverse activites seen in this park. The physical fitness trail is a popular spot for The Citadel students who live next door to the park. The park is an arboretum of sorts with many interesting species of trees and shrubs that grow in the Lowcountry. It is one of the few City of Charleston parks with restrooms and on-site parking.

It was a hub for Charleston’s African-American community from 1865–1954 that trained its students for professional careers and leadership roles.  In 1985, the alumni of the Avery Normal Institute, spearheaded by the Honorable Lucille Whipper, formed the Avery Institute of Afro-American History and Culture.  It joined with the College of Charleston to establish the Avery Research Center to preserve the legacy of the Avery Normal Institute and educate the community on the history and culture of African Americans in Charleston, the South Carolina Lowcountry, and South Carolina at large.  The Avery Research Center currently holds nearly 4000 primary- and secondary-source materials that document the history, traditions, legacies, and influence of African Americans and their place in the American narrative.
